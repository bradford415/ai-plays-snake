# Snake AI Using Deep Q-Learning
## Overview
This AI uses Deep Q-Learning to learn how to play the game snake. Essentially, the Deep Q-Network (DQN) is fed states. These states are specific
scenarios the snake will encounter throughout the game, encoded with one-hot labels. The DQN will update the action Q-values based on the 
reward system. The DQN will then choose an action, direction the snake should move, based on the new Q-values. This project has been 
accomplished by many others, however I chose to work on this project because it was fun and I learned a lot.

## Installation


### Motivation
This project was created to help me expand my knowledge of machine learning and reinforce what I learned in my [Creative Inquiry](https://github.com/CUFCTL).
It also gave me a fun project to work on over winter break.
